Success is not final, failure is not fatal
It is the courage to continue that counts
Believe you can and you're halfway there
The only way to do great work is to love what you do
Success usually comes to those who are too busy to be looking for it
Opportunities don't happen, you create them
Don't watch the clock; do what it does, keep going
Everything youâ€™ve ever wanted is on the other side of fear
Hardships often prepare ordinary people for an extraordinary destiny
Success is walking from failure to failure with no loss of enthusiasm
Don't be pushed around by the fears in your mind
Be led by the dreams in your heart
